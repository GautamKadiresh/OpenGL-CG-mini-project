The balloon popper game is a 2d single player game which was developed in c++ using
OpenGl. The player controls a paddleâ€™s movement along one direction and uses it to keep the
ball bouncing and popping the balloons. The game provides different difficulty settings
that change the gameplay speed and the paddle size. The goal of the game is to pop all the balloons on the screen by passing the
bouncing ball through them. The freeglut package was used to develop this game.
